# TUML

Simple tool I use to process german text without switching to a german keyboard.
It just converts things like 'ue' to 'Ã¼'.

Just copy the text you want to transform into your clipboard and run this tool.
The clipboard will be overwritten with the result.

## Installation

```
go install github.com/leandersteiner/tuml
```

```
tuml
```

This requires a go installation and the bin folder to be in your PATH.
If anyone is interested in this tool just hit me up and I will add automatic builds so you don't need go installed.
